    # because the sibilant.importlib functions will attempt to use
    # this module, we can't rely on them to in-turn load us. Thus for
    # just the builtins module, we'll do it manually. this is a simple
    # two-step process. First, we import bootstrap, which is written
    # in Python. It contains a good set of baseline definitions, as
    # well as the special form bindings needed for sibilant modules to
    # execute. Then we'll manually load the basics module, which is
    # written in Sibilant, using bootstrap as its __builtins__
    # definition. Finally, we'll merge the two modules together to
    # form the contents of this module.

    # 1. grab the bootstrap definitions
    import sibilant.bootstrap as bootstrap
